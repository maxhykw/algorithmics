# algorithmics

The project is focused on solving algorithmic exercises in the C programming language, emphasizing recursion, pointers, linked lists, and memory manipulation. The tasks involve implementing mathematical functions, list operations, and image processing techniques such as Quadtrees. Key goals include understanding algorithmic concepts and implementing them using recursion, iterative methods, and dynamic memory management techniques.
